This is a simulation of McKelveyâ€“Schofield's chaos theorem
Read more about this theorem at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i7L1ajtzc6o9bJvUiK8sXU8UpKNfK3h8/view?usp=sharing
Or the pdf file itself is in this folder as well

The program creates an intersection region, gets the furtest point away from the middle to create bigger win sets and checks whether end policy is within one of the win sets
Data are stored as nodes within the tree and the data stored is also output as a CSV.

Most of the functions and how it is used is commented next to the line.

More adjustments could be made to produce a more accurate representation of the real world situation.

Older versions can be checked in eg V1, V2, ... as Version 1,... (they are not required)

You are welcome to make changes and copy the code, giving credit as well would be apprechiated :)
